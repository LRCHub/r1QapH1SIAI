I like you better than sleepin' for days
And god knows my bed is my favorite place
Wrap myself up in the flannel and down
While the sun does a number on the folks downtown
But I would give up
My lazy ways
'Cause I like you better
Than sleepin' for days

I like you better than playing guitar
And that's pretty much the best thing I've found so far
The G to the F, A minor and C
Drown out the voices inside of me
Well I'd turn in my twelve string
And my dreams of being a star
'Cause I like you better
Than playin' guitar

I like you better than my self-doubt
That thing that never lets me go out of the house
That monster is my only friend
But I'd send him away and be happy again
I'd be one of those weirdos
With nothing to worry about
Cause I like you better
Than my self-doubt

I like you better than cold hard cash
I've been savin' up and I've got quite a stash
But I'll feed every bill to the ravenous fire
If for some reason that's what you desire
I'll convert all my savings
To embers and ash
'Cause I like you better
Than cash

I like you better than a six pack of beer
When that's perfect amount to make my vision unclear
But nowhere near enough that I don't think about you
And if I toss I few back that's all I'm gonna do
So I'm fine if the tallboys all disappear
'Cause I like you better
Than beer

I like you better than that song from my youth
The only one back then that told me the truth
It saved my life, God it made me feel good
But if I had to forget it forever I would

Cause I like you better
I like you better
I like you better
I like you better
